### General Rules:
- You have to create a GitHub repository where to upload your code. Each participant of the group should commit his/her own changes. There should be commit from all the members of the team
- You have to write a 4 (min)- 8(max) pages document in English with the following structure:
  - Introduction to the problem
  - Description of the state of the art (i.e., are there others’ works addressing this or a similar problem? What is different this time?)
  - Proposed approach (What procedure have you used? Why?)
  - Results (Plots and tables)
- The document has to be sent at least 3 days before the exam

Project:
The dataset in
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vc3tuql90ozsj7k18izr7/archive.zip?rlkey=4xxasdckqqc7mungxp3sznltp&dl=0

Contains images of different garbage objects.
- Explore the provided dataset
- Store the data in a suitable format/structure in a Database or Datawarehouse
- Compare multiple classifiers for kind of garbage classification
- Create your own testing dataset with photos you take
- (Extra) Apply object detection algorithms (es. Yolo) – not seen during the lectures – to identify multiple objects for a scene. Apply the classifier to each object (in the image)
